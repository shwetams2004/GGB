    &nbsp;<h2>About</h2>
    &nbsp;<p>We have all heard about the <abbr title="Golden Gate Bridge">GGB</abbr> which is known to be a symbol of the <em>power and progress</em><br> 
        of the United States. But it is also one of the most popular <em>suicide destination</em> in the world.<br> Every year around 30 people end their 
        lives miserably in this bridge! In this article I will <br>discuss ways to avoid suicides by realising life and how to get going happily without<br> taking 
        wrong decisions. I hope my article would help people who have such thoughts <br>and I really wish to draw them out of that devilish circle. </p>

    <p>This bridge is known for it's history of deaths by suicides. Stories revolve about people who have<br> committed or attempted to commit or survived the fall! 
The first know case was of a World War-1<br> Veteran, Harold B. Wobber. It's pretty obvious why this man took this decision as he was a veteran!<br>
But such excuses are for sure destructive. Several other people fell to their faitful death in the following<br> years. But there are some cases where survival was granted! Kevin Hines's story tells us <strong>what's in the<br> mind of a suicide survivor.</strong>
<em>"Jump now,"</em> said the voice in Kevin Hines's head. <em>"And I did. I was<br> compelled to die."</em>
One feeling every survivor (and probably the victims too might) have felt when<br> falling through the sky is <strong>regret.</strong>
The sense of regret ... regretting their life decisions, knowing what<br> they have done can not be take back was felt by them.
Kevin Hines's story tells us how he felt from <br>the very second he plunged into air! It's aftermath and consequences are heartbreaking!
Hines realized<br> that he made the greatest mistake of his life; so that you don't have to make the same!<br></p>

    <h3>Why People Consider Suicide As The Solution?</h3>
    <p>We all face difficult times in our lives. It's how we react to it that matters! Some of us overcome,<br> some ignore, some seek help, some forget, and some give up on life!
     If you go with the last option,<br> then this article is for you.When life hits you, hit it back with double impact! You are not in this<br> world to simply die and leave a void of your existence.When you feel hopeless, find hope in the<br> beautiful things that life provides. Look at the nature! It teaches us a great lesson how to overcome <br>difficulties and rise stronger that how you fell. Look at the life stories of people who are victims of<br> problems that they tried to escape, the only escape they found was<strong> not death! </strong>
     <em>“The person who completes<br> suicide, dies once. Those left behind die a thousand deaths, trying to relive those terrible moments and <br>understand… why?”</em>
     </p>

     <br>
     Have you imagined how your loved ones would feel if you simply disappear one day? <br>Don't think about any of your negatives, toxic people, failure, bad vibes or anything that makes you gloom.<br> Instead think about the ones who pray for you everyday, your family, friends, your own great memories and<br> things that matter!  You are here only once. So make it live longer; make it brighter!
     Like they say <strong>Place your hand<br> over your heart, can you feel it? That is called purpose. You’re alive for a reason so don’t ever give up.</strong>.<br> You are here for a purpose, I'm here for a purpose. We are all here for a purpose! Don't ever lose faith over<br> problems that can be tackled in a different way; in the right way. If you ever think suicide is the solution, then<br> you are wrong. It's only destruction! <br>

    <h3>How To Help Yourself</h3>

<br>
<p>If you understand the meaning of life and how many people wants you to be alive, you will never think<br>
 about killing yourself. You can help yourself by attending councelling if you are depressed or having any<br>
  thoughts of self-harm.
Imagine what if tomorrow holds a different turn in your life and it all goes good<br>
 thereafter? Would you wait till tomrrow, or will you just leave without an end?
Every unsolvable problem<br> in your life can be tackled in a matter of seconds! What you think would end your whole career could turn<br> out to be a blessing in disguise!
If you are experiencing a toxic environment around some people, just remember<br> those people are none of your business! Just cut ties off the people who make you feel worthless.
Ignore them<br> if you recieve hate; respect them if you get love. If you are worried about a particular incident, remember, <br>
no one else is gonna keep it in their minds 'cause the world keeps going...and so do you.

        <h3>Have Faith in the Supreme Being</h3>
        <p><strong>When you have faith in God, you don't have to worry about the future. You just know it's all in His<br> hands. You just go to and do your best.</strong></p>

        <p>When you belive in yourself, you <em>believe in God.</em> And by doing so you get strength to overcome difficult<br>
             times. At times when you feel down  look upon the bright side of life thats provided to us by faith. Hard<br>
              times, tough people and  unpleasant memories can be erased by the goodness of nature.Perhaps nature can<br>
               provide us examples of never giving upon in life.Before making any decision about self-harm think about<br>
                the people you love, memories that make you cherish the beautiful past and above all the blessings of the <br>
                supreme being.<br>

            <h3>Your Life is Precious!</h3>
            <p>We all have got just one life and that itself is short to an extend we fail to apprecite it.<br>
                Let's get with an example of King Solomon. King Solomon had a servant who admired him for<br> 
                his wisdom. The servant noticed that when King Solomon gets angry or sad he looks at his<br> 
                ring and the good mood returns. On the ring was written "this too shall pass"  <em>(in hebrew " Gam zeh ya'avor").</em><br>
                 The ring reminded King Solomon that life is short and he needs to do his best to be in a good mood and help<br> his people.
                 The realisation that anything in this world, be it good or bad, is all temprory. We need to keep moving.<br> Don't cling 
                 on to the past nor worry about the future. Everything happens for a reason! We need to appreciate life<br> in it's own way
                  of happiness and suffering.<br></p>
